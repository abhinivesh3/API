# API
### What are API
* APIS(Application Programming Interfaces) are tools that allow different software systems to communicate with each other, enabling them to share data and functionality.

### Why are APIs important?
* They help apps and websites share data and features
*  APIs make development faster by connecting services

### We'll look at 4 common types of APIs:
- REST API
- SOAP API
- GraphQL API
- WebSocket API

# REST API
(Representational State Transfer)

### What is it ?
- A widely used web architecture for communication over HTTP.

### When to use it:
- When you need a simple, stateless API that works well with HTTP methods.
- Best for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

# SOAP API
(Simple Object Access Protocol)

### What is it?
- A protocol for exchanging structured information, often used in enterprise apps.

### When to use it:
- When strict standards and high security are required.
- Ideal for financial services, payment gateways, or any enterprise-level applications.

# GraphQL API

### What is it?
- A flexible query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.

### When to use it
- When you need more control over the data you fetch (e.g., avoiding over-fetching).
- Great for applications with complex data relationships.

# WebSocket API

### What is it?
- Enables real-time,two-way communication between client and server over a persistent connection.

### When to use it
- When you need real-time communication, like in chat applications or live updates.
- Ideal for applications that require low latency and continuous data flow.
